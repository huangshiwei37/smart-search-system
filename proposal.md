# Proposal of smart search systems

1. Problem

There are some user-dynamic parking lots around rental apartment buildings or office buildings. In these parking lots, the users renting parking stalls may change from time to time since tenants move in / move out or staffs change their jobs. This sometimes causes inappropriate assignments of parking stalls to users. For example, a user of building A is first assigned a parking stall close to building B since there are no parking stalls available besides building A. However, when a parking stall close to building A becomes available, this user and managers may not be aware of the new vacancy without an autonomous management system. Another situation is that 
a user of building A is assigned a parking stall close to building B while another user of building B is assigned a parking stall close to builing A. These situations are bad for users especially in the winter of Winnipeg.

2. Idea

My idea is to develop a smart search system/website to find appropriate parking stalls for users. In this website, users are able to select their desirable parking stalls and the system is trying to help them find their wanted stalls by mathematical optimization techniques. The objective is that more users can get their wanted parking stalls. 


3. Information

The information the website will store includes a list of all parking stalls (each having a number, a size, and a location), a list of users (each having a name, an email, and a phone number), a list of vehicles (each having a owner, a plate number, a make, a model, a color, and a year), and a list of desirable parking stalls corresponding to each vehicle. The website also contains loggin information of users and administrators (a list of user emails and passwords, a list of administrator emails and passwords). 


4. features

  - Administrators can log in to the website with their emails and passwords. 

  - Administrators can add a new parking stall, update an existing parking stall, and remove an existing parking stall.

  - Administrators can assign a parking stall to a new user. They set up this new user's personal information (name, email, phone number), vehicle information, and the assoicated desirable parking stalls. At the same time, they generate and provide a registration code to this new user. By using this code, this new user can associate to his/her own information when he/she logs in to the website at a later time.

  - Administrators can help users add/update/remove their personal information, their vehicle information, and their desirable parking stalls. In this way, users can choose not to register in the website if they don't want to do or they don't know how to do. Users can provide their information to administrators by phone or in person.

  - Users can log in to the website with their emails and passwords. They can assoicate to their individual information by their own registration code provided by administrators.

  - Users can add/update/remove their own information.

  - A user is allowed to have more than one vehicles.

  - A user can be put into a waiting list when there are no parking stalls available or there are no stalls that this user wants.
